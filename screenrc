# Scroll back
# -----------
# xterm will not allow scrolling back if the alternate
# text buffer is selected (this happens when you start
# e.g. 'vi'. When you run 'screen', the same thing happens.) 
# The standard definitions of the termcap initialize capabilities
# ti and te (smcup & rmcup in terminfo) switch to and from the alternate text
# buffer. So you can tell xterm to enable scrolling back when
# 'screen' is running by adding the line:
termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@
# this works perfect when you only work on one window.
# But when you e.g. run 'man screen' on one of the windows,
# then switch to another window, the history of the current
# window is overlapped by the man contents on the previous 
# window. In this situation, if you want to see the history
# of your current window, you have to at first go to so-called
# 'copy mode' of 'screen' by typing: '^a ESC', then you can 
# use 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' to go back and forth in the 
# current window's history buffer (which is different from
# the xterm's history buffer). When you are done, type any key 
# which is not functional in 'copy mode' 
# to quit the 'copy mode'. You can use the following setting
# to set the size of the history buffer of the current window:
# (Use C-a i to view the current setting.)
defscrollback 5000
# suppress trailing blank lines when scrolling up text
# into the history buffer. Turn compacting `on' to hold
# more useful lines in your scrollback buffer

# Use the following line to tell applications (like vi) to
# use "alternate screen" in 'screen'

# 2. the following line tell screen to use
#    TERM hardstatus line to show the window
#    list. If TERM doesn't have hardstatus line
#    screen uses the last line to show it.
hardstatus lastline "%{= Bk}%H [%1`] | %-w%{= kB}%n*%t %{-}%+w"
